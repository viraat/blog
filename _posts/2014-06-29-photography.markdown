<p>A photo reminds us, who we were, what we have become and helps us to reflect at how we have turned out to be. Photos capture moments which we want to remember for the rest of our lives. Being an avid photographer myself, capturing landscapes and nature's serenity is a fun way to relax. The nostalgia felt when one sees old photos of friends, childhood and fun is feeling which can only be gotten from looking at photos. Some of our adventures are etched into our memory, the rest can be preserved carefully in the form of videos and photos. </p>

<p> Now let me move onto what I want to actually talk about <i>Photography</i>. Capturing photos is a hobby for most people. Some just love to take photos. Some love taking photos of themselves, that's self obsession.</p>

<p> But what is photography really about? To me it's something which I enjoy doing. I like to take photos because I feel that photos are the closest I shall get to travelling back into time. when ever I want to re-live a moment in my life, all I need is to look at a photo or a video, and I vividly recall what ever happened when that photo was taken. </p>

<p>Also, being a gadget freak I love cameras. I am fascinated and enthralled by the technology and working of these wonderful machines. Since the computer age the usage of rolls for cameras has almost been stopped. This has resulted in new age cameras like DSLRs, HD video cameras,etc. In another two years I guess that there will be standard 3D cameras available in the market. Although there are quite a few 3D cameras on the market they neither have good resolution and picture quality is not always consistent. </p>

<p>I'm going to wrap up this blog for now. It's my tribute to photography.</p>
<p>Never in all their history have men been able truly to conceive of the world as one: a single sphere, a globe, having the qualities of a globe, a round earth in which all the directions eventually meet, in which there is no center because every point, or none, is center — an equal earth which all men occupy as equals. The airman's earth, if free men make it, will be truly round: a globe in practice, not in theory.</p>



<p>Science cuts two ways, of course; its products can be used for both good and evil. But there's no turning back from science. The early warnings about technological dangers also come from science.</p>

<p>What was most significant about the lunar voyage was not that man set foot on the Moon but that they set eye on the earth.</p>

<p>A Chinese tale tells of some men sent to harm a young girl who, upon seeing her beauty, become her protectors rather than her violators. That's how I felt seeing the Earth for the first time. I could not help but love and cherish her.</p>

<p>For those who have seen the Earth from space, and for the hundreds and perhaps thousands more who will, the experience most certainly changes your perspective. The things that we share in our world are far more valuable than those which divide us.</p>

<p>There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.</p>

<blockquote>The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow. Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next ten.</blockquote>

<p>Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Reaching for the Stars</h2>

<p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>

<p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>

<p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
