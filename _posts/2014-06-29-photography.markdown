<p>A photo reminds us, who we were, what we have become and helps us to reflect at how we have turned out to be. Photos capture moments which we want to remember for the rest of our lives. Being an avid photographer myself, capturing landscapes and nature's serenity is a fun way to relax. The nostalgia felt when one sees old photos of friends, childhood and fun is feeling which can only be gotten from looking at photos. Some of our adventures are etched into our memory, the rest can be preserved carefully in the form of videos and photos. </p>

<p> Now let me move onto what I want to actually talk about <i>Photography</i>. Capturing photos is a hobby for most people. Some just love to take photos. Some love taking photos of themselves, that's self obsession.</p>

<p> But what is photography really about? To me it's something which I enjoy doing. I like to take photos because I feel that photos are the closest I shall get to travelling back into time. when ever I want to re-live a moment in my life, all I need is to look at a photo or a video, and I vividly recall what ever happened when that photo was taken. </p>

<p>Also, being a gadget freak I love cameras. I am fascinated and enthralled by the technology and working of these wonderful machines. Since the computer age the usage of rolls for cameras has almost been stopped. This has resulted in new age cameras like DSLRs, HD video cameras,etc. In another two years I guess that there will be standard 3D cameras available in the market. Although there are quite a few 3D cameras on the market they neither have good resolution and picture quality is not always consistent. </p>

<p>I'm going to wrap up this blog for now. It's my tribute to photography.</p>
