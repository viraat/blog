I want to understand Bayesian Inference. I know what it is, but I don't *really* understand it. Let's see if this writing thing is all that [I've made it up to be](2019/08/29/why.html). Here goes.  

Let's do the thing all sensible people do when they need to know what something means - look it up on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_inference):  
> Bayesian inference is a method of statistical inference in which Bayes' theorem is used to update the probability for a hypothesis as more evidence or information becomes available.

Sounds pretty straightforward, but let's unpack all of the terms that seem fuzzy individually. Statistical inference? Bayes' theorem? Hypothesis? Evidence? Let's go through them one by one. 

### Statistical inference

What is statistical inference? Actually, let's take a step back. What does *inference* mean?

Here's what [Wiki has to say](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inference):  
> Inferences are steps in reasoning, moving from premises to logical consequences.

Okay, what is a premise?
A premise is an assumption that some statement is true. A logical consequence shows that the statement is true. 

I'm going to start with statistical inference
