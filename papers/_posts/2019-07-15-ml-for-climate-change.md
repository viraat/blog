High level overview of how different areas of machine learning can solve problem in different scientific areas/industries to help the fight against climate change

- Main way to look at is to reduce Green house gas (GHG) emissions
- Broken down into mitigation, adaptation, and tools for action
- Mitigation organized by industries where different ML fields can contribute
- Solutions categorized into 
  - **high leverage**: bottlenecks in climate change mitigation that are well-suited to ML
  - **long term**: solutions with impact after 2040
  - **high risk**: risky in terms of uncertain tech, impact on GHG emissions unclear, potential for negative externalities

### Mitigation
