<p>I’m 20 years old, studying for my Bachelor’s in Engineering from Hyderabad, India.</p>



<p>I’ve been on a mission to code everyday. I’m an Android junkie and also a big fan of the Mac. I like to describe myself as a minimalist. </p>



<p>I love photography. The other passion being Golf. I now shoot in the high 70s having picked up the game at the Hyderabad Golf Club aged 9 years old. My color code is Red and Black. I’m an ardent Manchester United supporter. Being an Indian, loving cricket is probably in my genes. I’m a total book-worm, with Fantasy the favorite genre. I’m currently reading the Wheel of Time series by Robert Jordan.<p>



<p><i>I want to make the world a better place for future generations.</i></p>
