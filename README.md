A blog, nothing much to see here really.

## Getting this running

- Install jekyll and it's dependencies as outlined here: https://jekyllrb.com/
- Run `gem install jekyll bundler`
- From within the `blog` directory run `bundle install`. If this does not work delete the `Gemfile.lock` file and try again.
- `bundle exec jekyll serve`
